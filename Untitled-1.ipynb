    "# Caroline Radar-Coding Toolbox (CRCT)\n",
    "v1.0 - 27/03/2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caroline Radar-Coding Toolbox (CRCT) is a toolbox aimed at being integrated in Caroline, a computer system to process and analyze InSAR data recursively and automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The CRCT Radar-codes (computes radar coordinates starting from) the position of artificial targets falling within the Area-of-Interest of the stacks processed by Doris, taking the information about them from a database. The latter is denominated Database of Designaed Targets (DT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Radar coordinates are computed and stored into a file (Radar coordinates file, in the picture below). From that file, the coordinates can be parsed by an interface code (PSC file generation) into the DePSI working files.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRCT itself is therefore interfaced with Doris, DePSI, and the DT Database. In the following picture, a detailed diagram of the I/O interfaces of the code is shown.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolbox is composed of two tools: \n",
    "+ `selection.py`: aimed at selecting the DT falling into the area of interest\n",
    "+ `mainRC.py`: aimed at radar-coding the selected DT's coordinates. The latter is based on GECORIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### selection.py \n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Input* : a `selection.parms` file containing the run parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Output* : 3 files containing informations about the selected targets inside an Area of Interest (AoI)\n",
    "    + `reflectors.json` file, to ensure compatibility with GECORIS\n",
    "    + `reflectors.csv` file, to ensure compatibility with GECORIS and readability of output\n",
    "    + `SelectedTargetsMap.geojson` file, to visualize graphically the selected reflectors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### mainRC.py \n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Input* : a `RC.parms` file containing the run parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Output* : 3 files containing informations about the selected targets inside an Area of Interest (AoI)\n",
    "    + For each station with ID *xxxx* (es: BARN):\n",
    "      - `xxxx.json`: json file containing the log of the station's object\n",
    "      - `xxxx`: directory containing the SAR images cropped around the reflector at each epoch (only the ones when reflector was active)\n",
    "    + For each stack with ID *s1_yscyyy* (es: s1_dsc037):\n",
    "      - `s1_yscyyy.json`: json file containing the log of the stack's object\n",
    "    + `RadarCoordinates`: directory containing the information about the outcome of the RadarCoding process. Below, they are ordered with increasing level of detail:\n",
    "      1) `s1_yscyyy_RC.csv`: [for each stack] CSV file containing the coordinates of the reflectors. Its format is described in the next section.\n",
    "      2) `RCSanalysis_s1_yscyyy.png`: [for each stack] graph with the comparison between the predicted intensity and the measured intensity of the selected pixel.\n",
    "      3) `xxxx_s1_yscyyy_RC.png` [for each station and stack] timeseries of the Radar Coordinates (R,Az) along the stack. This is helpful to evaluate co-registration-induced errors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "With reference to the diagram of the CRCT, the Radar Coordinates corresponds to `s1_yscyyy_RC.csv`, while all the others are auxiliary plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to have the required libraries installed python environent by running the following line in the environment you'd like to use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install openpyxl matplotlib geopandas shapely\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "2. Download  `main.py` and `.parms` file from: https://github.com/Pbaz98/radarcoding-tool.git to the destination directory:\n",

This is useful as the coordinates conversion takes some minutes, so in case we want to perform multiple runs with the same database, after the first run we can copy-paste the converted coordinates (and epsg code) into the corresponding column of our local copy of the database, saving tiume and resources in the following runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"exclTarget\": this list is to be filled with the target's number that we want not to select.\n",

That version was updated on 8/18/2023, and all the epsg codes are specified (but they need to be confirmed)\n",
